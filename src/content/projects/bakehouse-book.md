Expanded on website style to create a robust book launch page, containing various kinds of content, into a visually compelling and readable format. I created the <a href="https://www.zingermansbakehouse.com/book/tunisian-orange-olive-oil-cake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe child page</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zingermansbakehouse.com/app/uploads/2018/04/Zingermans_Bakehouse-Olive_Oil_Cake.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recipe PDF</a> in InDesign.
