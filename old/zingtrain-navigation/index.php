        <img src="../img/zingtrain-menu.png" alt="ZingTrain site main navigation with a dropdown menu">
        <p>ZingTrain's main navigation was a single layer of menu items, and for a user to find the what they were
          looking for could take a lot of searching, not to mention the use of &ldquo;zingy&rdquo; terms that might not make sense.
          My team and I created a new navigation hierarchy and I designed the look of the dropdown menu. To get a better feel for how
          this navigation would move a guest through the site, I created a prototype in Sketch to mimic the movement, instead
          of seeing static images.</p>
