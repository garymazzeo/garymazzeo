        <p>This mini-site was created to promote <em>Parmigiano Reggiano</em>, and highlight the differences between the dairies from which the cheese is made in Italy. My favorite parts about it are the things I learned and tried out, like the use of SVGs for all of the illustrations, and using CSS’s border-image for the “tasting notes” section on the <a href="http://www.zingermanscommunity.com/parmproject/valserena/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dairy pages</a>. I took a style that was previously made for a printed newsletter and faithfully reproduced it on the web.</p>
